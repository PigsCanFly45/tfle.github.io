# Tools
I mostly code on my Macbook, so this list is more macOS-centric than not. At
home, I have Ubuntu running on WSL for an occasional change of scenery. For
specific settings, have a look at my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/tfle/dotfiles).

## Terminal
- [iTerm]: macOS terminal emulator
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): multiple terminal sessions in a window
-

## Text editor

## Managing the tools
