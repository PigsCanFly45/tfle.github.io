# About

I am a Master of IT student at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au). You may also know me from [USYD](https://www.sydney.edu.au), where I dabbled in Medical Physics, or [ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au), where I majored in Astronomy.

I run [coding and robotics classes](https://jnrengineers.com.au) in Sydney where I help primary school students develop their problem-solving capability, communication skills and programming ability.

When I'm not collecting degrees, or teaching in the classroom, I like to keep busy with unimportant nonsense in the company of friends and family.
