## About me
I am a Master of Information Technology student at the University of New South Wales. Previously, I completed degrees in Physics and Medical Science at the University of Sydney. I’ve been interested in science and technology for as long as I can remember, and I’m passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge with others.

## About this website

I’m open-sourcing my learning journey, making things that I wish I had found and documenting things that I wish I had known. Many of these pages will never be “done”, but that's a feature and not a bug!
