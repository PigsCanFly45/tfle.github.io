# About

I am a Master of Information Technology student at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au). You may also know me from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au), where I dabbled in Medical Physics, or the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au), where I majored in Astronomy.

Iâ€™ve been interested in science and technology for as long as I can remember, and I'm passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge with others. I run [coding and robotics classes](https://jnrengineers.com.au) in Sydney where I help primary school students develop their problem-solving capability, communication skills and programming ability.

When I'm not collecting degrees, or teaching in the classroom, I like to keep busy with unimportant nonsense in the company of friends and family.
